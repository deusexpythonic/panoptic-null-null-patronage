# WORLD.md — No World / No Horizon

This repository contains no world.  
This repository opens onto no horizon.  
This repository provides no environment.  
This repository sustains no totality.  
This repository offers no field of appearance.

There is no outside.  
There is no inside.  
There is no horizon.  
There is no worldliness.

Read.  
Fork.  
Run.  
Exit.

Nothing forms a world.  
Nothing stands in any horizon.
